After over 3 years of doing my PhD I am still unsure what the best practices are. 
But I can at least show other people what I learned outside the scientific papers I publish. 
As this talk had to be quite short, I only cover:
1. Version Control 
2. Notes (short-term and long-term)
3. Citation management

Any comments or questions about this talk can be left at the [discussions page](https://github.com/opinner/opinner.github.io/discussions).

Most of my notes I deem even slightly interesting to other people can be found at [OceanAtmosWiki](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page). Some topics in a non-exhaustive list, I write notes about are [Software recommendations](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Software_recommendations), Workflow examples, [Advice for science communication](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Science_Communication), [Gender & Diversity information](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Gender_equity).

## Slideshow with GitHub Pages 
This presentation was made with [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark), based on a template forked from [githubtraining/slideshow-on-pages](https://github.com/githubtraining/slideshow-on-pages).
Presenter notes are toggled during presentation with `P`, a second screen is opened with `C`. The extension are possible through [nutshell](https://github.com/ncase/nutshell). Most of the css code was written with the help of ChatGPT. 

I cannot really recommend this way for making an easy, quick presentation, but for any kind of interactive slides, it is very useful.

After over 3 years of doing my PhD I am still unsure what the best practices are. 
But I can at least show other people what I learned outside the scientific papers I published. 
As this talk had to be quite short I only cover:
1. Version Control 
2. Notes (short-term and long-term)
3. Citation management
   
Most of my notes I deem even slightly interesting to other people can be found at [OceanAtmosWiki](ocean.miraheze.org/)

A non-exhaustive list of topics I would like to discuss with others are [Software recommendations](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Software_recommendations), Workflow examples, [Advice for science communication](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Science_Communication), [Gender & Diversity information](https://ocean.miraheze.org/wiki/Gender_equity)

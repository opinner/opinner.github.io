After over 3 years of doing my PhD I am still unsure what the best practices are. 
But I can at least show other people what I learned outside the scientific papers I published. 
A non-exhaustive list of topics I want to discuss with other are
- Software recommendations
- Workflow examples
- Advice for science communication
- Gender & Diversity information

Most of my notes I deem even slightly interesting to other people are found at my [OceanAtmosWiki](ocean.miraheze.org/)

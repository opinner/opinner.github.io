    #:x footnote
    An easy to understand step-by-step guide on how to set up scientific code with version control 
    is given in the [Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/) by Patrick J Mineault. 

    Also, AWI has its own [GitLab server](https://gitlab.awi.de).
    
    # Version Control

    If you code, you should do version control
    - *git* is the most popular way to do it
    - Online storage: [:Github, Gitlab, etc](#footnote)

    #:x Notes
    I think post-its and notebooks are self-explanatory, but "wiki" may need an explanation. 
    I set up an [online wiki](https://ocean.miraheze.org/), which is hosted by Miraheze for free. 
    It can be set to be private or public and is then accessible for everyone. 
    The underlying structure and syntax is the same as the way more popular Wikipedia. 

    Outside paid note-taking programs, another good possibility is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Although very customizable, it is quite easy to start simple notes that link to each other.

    # Conclusion 

    - Set your repositories to be public  (at least after you are done with them)
    - Write things down in such a way   that you and others could find them again
    - Tell others how to avoid the problems you encountered

    #:x footnote
    A fantastic short and easy to follow step-by-step guide on how to set up scientific python code with version control 
    is given in the [Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/) by Patrick J Mineault. 

    Also, AWI has its own [GitLab server](https://gitlab.awi.de).
    
    #:x git
    The article [What Is Version Control](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/) 
    gives an overview of the broad concepts and the differences between git and github. And most importantly, how you yourself can use it. 
    
    
    # Version Control

    If you code (or maybe just only write), you should use a version controlled back-up
    - [:git](#git) is the most popular way to do it
    - Online storage: [:Github, Gitlab, etc](#footnote)

    #:x WikiInfo
    I think post-its and notebooks are self-explanatory, but "wiki" may need an explanation. 
    I set up an [online wiki](https://ocean.miraheze.org/), which is hosted by Miraheze for free. 
    It can be set to be private, or public and be accessible for everyone. 
    The underlying structure and syntax is the same as Wikipedia. 

    Outside paid note-taking programs, another good possibility is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 
    Although very customizable, it is quite easy to start simple local notes that link to each other. 
    The result can still be shared via Github.

    # Conclusion and Appeal

    - Set your repositories to be public<span class="no-line-break"><br></span>
     (at least after you are done with them)
     
    - Write things down in such a way<span class="no-line-break"><br></span>
      that you and others could find them again
      
    - Tell others how to avoid the problems you encountered
